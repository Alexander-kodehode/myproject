        <h4>What is programming?</h4>
        <p>Alot of people confuse coding and programming but they're no the same.
            Programming is a process that creates programs that involve 
            the ratification of codes. While coding is a skill that's needed
            to communicate with a computer through a programming language 
            like javascript or pythong. Coding means that you have basic programming skill
            without any programming tools. If we put it another way coding 
            is apart of programming while programming is an all encompassing word.
